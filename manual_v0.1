IMPORTANT: using this script will incur money loss accoring to the time your spot instances will be running.
MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS, DO NOT USE CARDS WITH MONEY ON IT IF YOU ARE NOT READY TO LOSE THEM

I assume you have basic understanding about running docker containers and using terminal and general IT-expertise if you are reading this.

This is manual to ghetto-loic implementation using the bombardier stress-test tool.
More info about tool here https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/codesenberg/bombardier?utm_source=godoc 
Ghetto-loic uses  'alpine/bombarideri' docker image to "stress-test" targets.


What you need to run this:
- AWS account
- key pair to connect over SSH (optional)
- AWS security group to connect to instance over SSH (optional)
- installed aws-cli v2
- run aws configure and supply details, you can get them in your AWS account, google how to do it.
- make sure to 'chmod +x ebash.sh' file to be able to run it
- ./ebash.sh kremlin.ru fsb.ru sber.ru

How it works (so far):
- run ebash.sh script with up to 3 targets domain names/IPs (it was tested with 3 targets, you can use more)
- it creates AWS EC2 Spot requests for 4(four) t3.medium servers with base Ubuntu 20 AMI (depends on the region) in Stockholm region eu-north-1a (it depends on the region you register your aws-cli tool), with price of 0.04 USD and termination protection disabled
- servers will automatically install docker.io and should start stress-testing targets for 1 hour
- in 3900 seconds servers will self-terminate
- instructions are encoded in base64 and sent to EC2 instances with UserData
- aws-cli pages whole info about request to terminal, just press 'q' to close it

In case of any questions review ebash.sh, specification and spec files.
